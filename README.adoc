= adoc2html, a compiler I'll never finish

== What is this project?

`adoc2html` is intended to be a simple compiler converting AsciiDoc files to HTML.

The output HTML intends to not be overly bloated with unnecessary items and is meant to be
easily customizable with CSS. I plan on adding a few example CSS styles and the ability to
import them via the CLI flags.

== Technologies

The compiler will (maybe) be written in ANSI C, adhering to the standards defined in the
Port70 C89 draft (https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c89/c89-draft.html[original],
https://github.com/bratpeki/port70-ansi-c-draft[backup on my GitHub]).

AsciiDoc is currently
https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-lang[still in the process
of being standardized], and the latest build of the standard is `0.3.0`.
Therefore, this compiler relies on the popular AsciiDoctor project, which features a

It also comes in
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/_exports/asciidoc-pre-spec.pdf#syntax-quick-reference[PDF].
This is my main reference for the language specification as of now.
